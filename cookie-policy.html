      <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 11 November 2025</p>

      <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Cristian Radu ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on Time & Date. We use these technologies to make our service work properly, to improve your experience, and to understand how our site is used. You are in control — you can manage or withdraw your consent for non-essential cookies at any time.</p>

      <h2>Our Approach to Cookies</h2>

      <p>We believe in being transparent about how data is collected and used. Our goal is to use cookies responsibly — only for legitimate purposes like improving performance, security, and personalization, not for unnecessary tracking.</p>

      <p>We cooperate with data protection authorities and regulators as required by law and are committed to resolving any concerns related to our use of cookies and tracking technologies.</p>
